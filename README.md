# aoc-2019

## I didn't do very well last year. Here's to take 2.

### THE PLAN:
 * Actually take time to progress through each day.
 * Try to learn a new Language during AoC.
   * Go (As of Dec 2, 2019, I've decided to stop using Lua and go with Go.)
 * Not give up.
 * Document all code to the best of my ability so that I can understand happened here when I look back years later.
